#### Hi, Iâ€™m Cate Geiman, a student and aspiring wildlife biologist.
-------------
I'm currently working on a collaborative research project analyzing the occupancy and activity patterns of the four species within genus Tapirus. 
This is in an effort to publish a comprehensive study providing more insight into the habitat and time usage of tapir, 
aiding in conservation efforts. See my repository *Tapir-Research-2023* and my team's organization *Mooring-Research* for more!
